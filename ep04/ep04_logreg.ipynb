    "### Topics / concepts explored in this EP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation of the **logistic regression algorithm**, using the gradient descent technique\n",
    "- Application on binary classification of images, using their feature representation\n",
    "- Confusion matrix, effects of unbalanced classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete and submit this notebook. **PLEASE do no change the file name.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation  \n",
    "- Correctitude of the algorithms\n",
    "- Code\n",
    "    - do not change the prototype of the functions\n",
    "    - efficiency (you should avoid unnecessary loops; use matrix/vector computation with NumPy wherever appropriate)\n",
    "    - cleanliness (do not leave any commented code or useless variables)\n",
    "- Appropriateness of the answers\n",
    "- File format: Complete and submit this notebook <font color=\"red\">with the outputs of the execution</font>. **Do no change the file name.**\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "- It might be wise to first make sure your implementation is correct. For instance, you can compare the results of your implementation and of the one implemented in <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>. After you feel confident, paste your code in the notebook, and then run the rest of the code in the notebook.\n",
    "- If you face difficulties with Keras or other libraries used in this notebook, as well as clarity issues in the exercises in this notebook, post a message in the <a href=\"https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/forum/view.php?id=2785513\">Forum for discussions</a>."
